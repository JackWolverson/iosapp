# iosapp
the iOS app i created for my uni module using twitterkit, and the real time trains API.
Due to time constraints the app was not finished but received a 2:1  

the coursework for the app was to create an app implementing a framework, API and data persistance. the app produced was designed to hold the location of the user then allow the user to save train journeys and notify the user to when to leave for the train staion to catch that train. the app also had the twitterfeed of network rail so the user could look at updates on the trains. A futher implementation of this could be to choose the local train service to look at local changes.
